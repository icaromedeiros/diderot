\chapter{Introduction}

Ontology engineering is a hard task. Many methodologies have been proposed
to cope with this task %cite

% ontology engineering -> waterfall

While these methodologies are of value, sometimes ontology authors
can not know by advance what kinds of inferences their ontologies will
provide. Checking the ontology for self-consistency is also a demanding task.

Moreover, Test Driven Development techniques have been successfully used in
software engineering, providing an iterative, agile and incremental way of developing
code. Ontology engineering could benefit from a process like this, using small iterations
to ensure a good quality ontology, consistent, well tested and ready for evolution.
